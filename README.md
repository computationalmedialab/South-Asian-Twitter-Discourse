## Data Collection
We collected data using [a X Scraper from Apify](https://apify.com/apidojo/tweet-scraper). In order to replicate this project, you will need access to the project data archive. The data is stored in this archive in many spreadsheets with all tweets and their metadata across the search terms used.
